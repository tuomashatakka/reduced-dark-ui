# Reduced Dark

*Minimal + plain - yet usable + functional*

UI theme for Atom.io.
While being clean and simple, does not compromise usability.

This theme is an attempt to wrap the currently-not-as-intuitive-as-it-could-be paneling scheme in Atom for reduced obstruction by obsolete panels that fill the screen and reduce your precious code editor into a thin line with max line length of ~50 characters (ðŸ˜„) at best. This is implemented by making the side panels collapse into a tool-bar of sort. **Feedback is great**ly valuable and appreciated here. 

If some package doesn't display correctly, please raise an issue and I'll do my best at supporting it. Panel collapsing should be generically implemented enough to cause few to none inconsistencies though. 

Also hella lotta configuration options (on their way). 
Seriously, it will be like candyland.


### Configuration 

TBA (Short descriptions in the settings themselves) 


### Motivation

Atom needs more well written & throughoutly thought themes. Code editor running on webkit? Why aren't you making a package already? 

Cross the boundaries, innovate, try new things. Do not fear to fall. Learn to fall the right way (what is the right way for you anyway) instead. Atom's stylesheet may be **literally** opened with two clicks, any time you want it. Try new things. Is a blocking modal a good idea if you need to provide some information that is available behind the modal? Probably not. Try new things. How about split view or similar? Sounds noice. Above all, remember: try new things! 

If you get an idea, write it down. Testing happens naturally when you continue what you were doing in the first place ðŸ˜ƒ If it works, congrats! You'll get my admiration and thumbs up. Convert it to a package or a theme and publish it. It's not as hard as it may sound if you've ever opened the infamous Atom Flight Manual. PS, ES6 just works - no need for coffee shit ðŸ˜˜

The key is that not an inch of screen estate should be wasted to something that does not provide usability or functionality, but that doesn't mean things could not be beautiful. Just try and do implement only the features that make sense, postpone the polishing until the end.



### Inspiration and thanks

This theme was inspired by the
 - Northem
 - Material; and
 - Seti
themes.
 Material UI, Seti UI and Northem UI themes.

I liked the structuring of Northem so much that I actually used the Northem's source (with some heavy modifications though) for creating the bootstrap from which this mastdrpiece emerged. 

So, thanks to all authors and contributors involved in making my Atom experience top notch!
